    "description": "Tremendous helps businesses send payouts to people. The Tremendous platform allows organizations to pay people around the world. One core element of our platform is choice. People have different preferences for how they prefer to be paid. Organizations use Tremendous to give their recipients a choice of money, prepaid cards, gift cards and charity donations.  We also handle the rest of the tricky stuff\u2013currency conversions, money movement, cross-border regulations, and reporting. And if something ever goes wrong, our customer support team is best-in-class and ready to help. We're just getting started.  Payroll services help organizations pay their employees... but what about everyone else? The user who participated in a live feedback session, the job applicant who did a take-home project, the loyal customer who put up with a terrible bug?  Organizations are constantly working with people, and then struggling to find ways to compensate them. That's what Tremendous is here to solve.",
