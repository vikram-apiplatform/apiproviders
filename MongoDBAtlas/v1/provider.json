    "description": "The MongoDB Atlas Data API lets you read and write data in Atlas with standard HTTPS requests. To use the Data API, all you need is an HTTPS client and a valid API key.  Clients send requests to specific endpoints, which each represent a MongoDB operation. The API includes endpoints that create, read, update, delete, and aggregate documents in your cluster. Requests specify a collection and include operation-specific parameters like a query filter or update description. Additionally, all incoming requests must include a Data API key to authenticate the calling user.  For each request, the Data API authenticates the user and checks the cluster's read/write permissions. If the user's request is authorized, then the API validates the request, runs the corresponding database operation, and returns the result in an HTTPS response.",
