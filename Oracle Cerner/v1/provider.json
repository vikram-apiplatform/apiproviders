We use the latest technology to create solutions that let communities and people engage in their own health. Whether they are supporting the clinical, financial or operational areas of a hospital or health system, our tools are designed to work for today and think for tomorrow.  We support our clients by surfacing data that enables them to make informed decisions for better management of operations, while arming their clinicians with the information they need to provide smarter care. Empowering them to know, manage and engage with the people they serve. All to disrupt the industry and transform the way healthcare is delivered.  It\u2019s our mission to relentlessly seek breakthrough innovation that will shape healthcare of tomorrow. And we believe that what we do doesn\u2019t just impact healthcare \u2013 it impacts the world. It\u2019s why, more than ever, healthcare is too important to stay the same.",
